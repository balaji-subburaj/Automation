# üß™ Automation Testing Projects (Hands-on Training and Hackathon)

Welcome to my Automation Testing Projects repository! This repository showcases a collection of hands-on projects I've completed as part of my training in automation testing. These projects were developed using various frameworks and tools, including Selenium, Cucumber, and more, with guidance from the Way2Automation course on Udemy. Additionally, it features my hackathon project focused on web application automation.

## üöÄ Projects Overview

### Learning Outcomes

### 1. DataDrivenFramework
A robust data-driven testing framework designed to execute tests with different data sets automatically. This framework leverages Excel sheets as data sources to ensure comprehensive test coverage.

### 2. Cucumber Framework
This project demonstrates Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) using the Cucumber framework. It includes feature files written in Gherkin language, along with step definitions in Java.

### 3. Page Object Model with Factories
An implementation of the Page Object Model (POM) using factory design patterns. This project organizes web element interactions, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

### 4. Test Data Management
Focused on managing test data, this project automates the creation, manipulation, and validation of test data across various testing environments.

### 5. XML and JSON Testing
Automation scripts to validate and test XML and JSON data formats. These tests ensure that data structures comply with the expected formats and content requirements.
